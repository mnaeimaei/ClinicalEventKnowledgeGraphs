The intra-abdominopelvic structure is bounded by, but excludes the following 'wall' structures: superiorly the thoracic diaphragm; inferiorly the pelvic diaphragm; anteriorly the anterior abdominal wall (including the lateral abdominal wall); and posteriorly the wall of the abdominal proper segment of trunk.
